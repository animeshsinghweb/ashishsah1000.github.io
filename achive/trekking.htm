                <h1 style="color:grey;"><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> A Adventerous journey with friends <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></h1>
                <p>As I had joined TATA Steel in 2015, I was quite excited to go to Uttarkashi for a camping trip. It was a self-development program. Every year TATA steel send his trainees for this module. We have to register at TSAF website and after TATA
                    Steel will pay for our journey. All were waiting for the journey and as usual a <span style="color:red;">heaven for couples :) even I proposed two three girls but unfortunately, they were not from TATA steel </span>,I should have taken
                    care of that before proposing :( </p>
                <h2 style="color:grey;">Fun on the Train:</h2>
                <p>The journey started on 12th April 2017. At 6 am we all gathered at Jamshedpur railway station and were waiting for the Utkall Express. My first-time experience of the AC compartment in the train. The journey was quite well and I was
                    <b style="color:red;">hearing songs and just eating</b> all the things which the sellers were bringing. My friends were playing UNO cards, cards and one of the best things in which I took great interest <b style="color:red;">Antaksari</b>.
                    The journey was going well Window seat + Music, I was just lost somewhere.</p>
                <h2 style="color:grey;">Approaching Towards Uttarkashi:</h2>
                <p>We had reached at Uttrakhand station at night 10.30 pm it was nearly two days journey. We were tired, so we booked the hotel as soon as it was possible. After booking the hotel we had our dinner and finally, we went to our bed at 1 am.
                    At morning after getting ready I rushed towards the market. After having our breakfast, I bought few fruits and key rings for my pen drive. Finally, we were on the bus, the bus started and <b style="color:red;"> as it was approaching towards its aim, people
                    in the bus started approaching towards vomiting</b>. I was concentrated that nothing will happen to me. I was just enjoying the music and nature by sitting near the window seat. Finally, we reached Uttarkashi and now we have to go
                    5 km inside a jungle to reach our base camp. There was a heavy rain and the roads were very thin. It was a nightmare for us, but let's appreciate the courage of our bus driver, he was graduated in driving or if he was not I would give
                    him that degree after seeing his driving skill in such worst situation.</p>
                <p>As we all reached near the TSAF base camp we were said that the camp is 150m above the level of which were standing. We have to climb now 150m and the way was totally <b style="color:red;">slippery and a steep climbing, that too with
                    luggage the situation becomes more horrible</b>. It was dark and raining but we the smart heroes and heroines succeeded in this job without any damage to anything.</p>
                <h2 style="color:grey;">Five Days: Base Camp</h2>
                <p>We reached there at night we got all the things and <b style="color:red;"> even scolding because we reached late</b>. We got the instruction of the programs which will be held next day and the daily routine. We went for dinner. There was
                    a nice dining hall in between of the hills, A big tent in which there were tables and chairs. We were hungry so we loved the food that day. Daily <b style="color:red;">we had to get up at 5.30 am make yourself ready and then at 6.30 am there will
                    be PT</b>. one thing which I loved about PT they use to take us in the mountains. Though the PT was very difficult still Nature was so beautiful that it inspired everyone. After PT there will be games and at night we usually use to
                    go to bed at 10 o'clock. Sharing our stories with friends, when we use to fall asleep we don't know. The food was healthy and it's an arbitrary nature that we don't like good things, so all were complaining about the food. But <b style="color:red;">"Subha
                    Subha rajma and roti koi deta hai kya wo v usko jo rajma free m v nhi khata"</b>. That time for me glucose D of orange flavor was not less than Red Bull and tea was the hope for eating chapattis even I do not like tea much. </p>
                <p>In between these days, we went for rock climbing and for flying fox. Instructors there were awesome in their job, They were performing stunts in front of us that too without any safety. But they were awesome.<b style="color:red;"> I was the worst performer
                    of that day and even I was the joke of the day</b>. Then we went for rock climbing and there I was very enthusiastic though, it was difficult, I was having fun. There we used to drink the river water, So there was no scarcity of water
                    <b style="color:red;"> jitna maan kare pio and even ghar v le jao</b>.</p>
                <h2 style="color:grey;">Village visit and Forest camp</h2>
                <p>Forest camp, we were told to travel at the top of the mountain and after reaching the camping area we have to make our tent in which we will sleep, even the foods had to be prepared in the handmade Chulha. We have to spend the whole
                    <night></night>
                    in the forest, We have to gather dry woods for cooking and without lights, we have to manage the night. While we were climbing to reach the camping area, many people gave up. They were tired exhausted<b style="color:red;"> as we even have to take the <rack></rack>
                    shack bag with us</b>, which was filled with required things, It was very heavy. I was just shouting, motivating others and hearing/singing songs. It was an interesting and a good experience.</p>
                <p>Village visit was full of excitement, We had to carry our rack sack bag full of things and then we had to visit the Uttrao village. We started our journey early morning. The route was lengthy but my headphones were with me. We just kept
                    moving and after crossing many crooked ways we reached the Uttrao village. We stopped at a temple situated there, After that, we went to a school where the students were studying,<b style="color:red;">we Guided them how to succeed in life as a failure can
                    guide good and the best thing is that we were Engeeniers without any degree</b>.</p>
                <h2 style="color:grey;">Approaching towards our Aim:</h2>
                <p>And now the main journey begins, We started our journey with 18kg of the load at our back. That moment when we started with such a load was really dreadful. But as we kept on moving it was all good. We took a break at many points and the
                    best part which kept me energetic was the beautiful nature. We kept on moving in groups. People were exhausted, they were asking for break many times. I just kept on moving and kept on challenging myself. We reached our first point
                    now we have to make the tent so that we can sleep in the night. All were tired, We refreshed ourselves with PT. After that, we cooked food and after eating everyone went to sleep. I was busy admiring the stars and hearing songs.</p>
